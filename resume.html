      <h1><ins>This is my AWESOME resume:<ins></h1>
   <p> What stands out to me over the course of three years in high school was starting a History Bowl club with my friend. History bowl is basically a statewide competition that involves answering fast-paced history questions that are initially obscure, but become easier to answer as they are read by a score-keeper. I felt that the overall experience of building an organization from the ground up taught me a lot about recruiting and organizing people, working as a group, and developing a love and appreciation of knowledge. The skills I learned when I started this club will benefit me throughout my life. </p>
